Statements, was approved.)
M. R. BASTIEN (Haiti) (Translation Jon the
â€˜rench) ; Mr. President, we received this document
this morning. Will you allow us to read it before
putting these different proposals to the vote? Ido
not mean to read the whole document, but to read
the different points separately as we go along.
The PRESIDENT (Translation from the French) :
We will wait a few minutes so that everyone can take
full cognizance of the purportof the different resolu-
tions.
