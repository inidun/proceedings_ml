then consider items 1, 2. 3, 4 and 5 of its agenda. Two further items should be added to the agenda,
namely: 6. Date of Extraordinary Session of the General Conference ; and 7. Date of the next
meeting of the Headquarters Committee.

circulation of preliminary plans outside the immediate circle of the Headquarters Committee.
(3) The CHAIRMAN replied that the matter could be discussed with Mr. Breuer.
(4) The agenda, as amended by the Chairman, was adopted.
APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING
(5) The minutes of the last meeting (7C/HQ/SR. 4) were approved.
(6) At the request of the ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL, Mr. MONTAGNIER reported on the
arrangements concluded with the group of three architects. He recalled that the Committee, at its
last meeting, had expressed a wish that expenses be reduced as much as possible ; the Secretariat
had accordingly negotiated with the architects with that aim in view and, thanks to their spirit of
co-operation, it had been possible to reduce their fees by $5,000, i. e. from $30,000 to $25,000.
