THE PRESENTING OF THE PRELIMINARY PLAN TO FRENCH AUTHORITIES (Meeting of 21 April 1953)
(29) Mr. MONTAGNIER reported on behalf of Mr. Valeur that, after the meeting of 21 April, all
the competent French services had received and were making a study of the preliminary plan. The
French Government would forward the comments of those services before the opening of the Confer-
ence.
(30) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) pointed out, in connexion with document 2 XC/Z, that the
British experts were referring to Mr. Le Corbusier’s opinion of the Conference building, which
seemed to them faulty in some respects. He drew special attention to the slope of the roof, the fact
that the delegates’ offices had no natural light or windows, and the unsatisfactory acoustics of the
room designed for plenary sessions, and wondered whether it would be possible to raise the height
of the building. The distance separating it from the office building was a still more serious diffi-
culty. In conclusion, Mr. Cowell thought it would probably be necessary to give further study to
that part of the plan.
(31) After some discussion, Mr. MONTAGNIER said that in his opinion there was no question of
modifying the general structure, but that further study was required - a view with which all the
architects concurred.
(32) It was decided to adjourn discussion of that point, pending the receipt of further information.
MISCELLEANEOUS QUESTIONS
(33) The minutes of the last session were approved, subject to any corrections that had already
been or might be received.
