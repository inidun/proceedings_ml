those delegations, and consent to the inclusion of the issue of global problems under
item 11 of the agenda.
(3.3) As for the second draft - concerning the "Strengthening of Unesco's role in the
struggle against the inhuman ideology of militarism, hegemonism, racism and apartheid" -
in view of the opinions expressed by a number of delegates, the Soviet delegation and our
co-authors do not object to the title of this item being amended by omitting the words
"the inhuman ideology of" and placing "racism and apartheid" first. We also agree to this
issue being considered as part of item 18.
(3.4) And now to the question of the implementation of the Declaration on the mass media.
In our understanding, most speakers have supported the proposal to\treat this issue-as а
separate agenda item, providing that it has no financial implications. After consultations
with distinguished representatives of the Secretariat and of the General Committee, we
have also concluded that this issue may be left as a separate item. At the same time it
was decided that this arrangement should be recorded in the minutes. Thank you for your
attention.
